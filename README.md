# JSON Parser

After building basic parser combinator libraries in the
[system-f Haskell course](https://github.com/system-f/fp-course) as well as in
[FP in Scala](https://github.com/fpinscala/fpinscala), I decided to build something
using [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/parsec), a well established
combinator library. This also gave me a chance to try out some of the tools in the
Haskell ecosystem including auto-generating documentation
using [Haddock](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/haddock) and property-based
testing along with unit tests in [Tasty](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/tasty).
